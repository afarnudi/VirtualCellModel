# Doxyfile 1.8.11

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all text
# before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the iconv
# built into libc) for the transcoding. See http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv
# for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "The Virtual Cell Model"

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          =
PROJECT_NUMBER         = 1.0

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           = ./Doxygen/logo_1.png

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = 

XML_OUTPUT             = ./Doxygen/xml

EXCLUDE		       =  ../include/cxxopts.hpp

USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE =  ./Doxygen/Main_Page.md

# The HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify additional user-defined
# cascading style sheets that are included after the standard style sheets
# created by doxygen. Using this option one can overrule certain style aspects.
# This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET since it does not replace the
# standard style sheet and is therefore more robust against future updates.
# Doxygen will copy the style sheet files to the output directory.
# Note: The order of the extra style sheet files is of importance (e.g. the last
# style sheet in the list overrules the setting of the previous ones in the
# list). For an example see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = ./Doxygen/custom.css \
                         ./Doxygen/custom_dark_theme.css

# The HTML_EXTRA_FILES tag can be used to specify one or more extra images or
# other source files which should be copied to the HTML output directory. Note
# that these files will be copied to the base HTML output directory. Use the
# $relpath^ marker in the HTML_HEADER and/or HTML_FOOTER files to load these
# files. In the HTML_STYLESHEET file, use the file name only. Also note that the
# files will be copied as-is; there are no commands or markers available.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_EXTRA_FILES       = ./Doxygen/doxy-boot.js

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE tag controls the color of the HTML output. Doxygen
# will adjust the colors in the style sheet and background images according to
# this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a colorwheel, see
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information. For instance the value
# 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is blue, 300
# purple, and 360 is red again.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 359, default value: 220.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE    = 220

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT tag controls the purity (or saturation) of the colors
# in the HTML output. For a value of 0 the output will use grayscales only. A
# value of 255 will produce the most vivid colors.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 255, default value: 100.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT    = 100

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA tag controls the gamma correction applied to the
# luminance component of the colors in the HTML output. Values below 100
# gradually make the output lighter, whereas values above 100 make the output
# darker. The value divided by 100 is the actual gamma applied, so 80 represents
# a gamma of 0.8, The value 220 represents a gamma of 2.2, and 100 does not
# change the gamma.
# Minimum value: 40, maximum value: 240, default value: 80.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA  = 80

# If the HTML_TIMESTAMP tag is set to YES then the footer of each generated HTML
# page will contain the date and time when the page was generated. Setting this
# to YES can help to show when doxygen was last run and thus if the
# documentation is up to date.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_TIMESTAMP         = YES

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES, doxygen will include brief member
# descriptions after the members that are listed in the file and class
# documentation (similar to Javadoc). Set to NO to disable this.
# The default value is: YES.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES

# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the brief
# description of a member or function before the detailed description
#
# Note: If both HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC are set to NO, the
# brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.
# The default value is: YES.

REPEAT_BRIEF           = YES

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the full path
# before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the
# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = YES

# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make doxygen treat a
# multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// comments) as
# a brief description. This used to be the default behavior. The new default is
# to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed description. Set this
# tag to YES if you prefer the old behavior instead.
#
# Note that setting this tag to YES also means that rational rose comments are
# not recognized any more.
# The default value is: NO.

MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = NO
GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

# If the treeview is enabled (see GENERATE_TREEVIEW) then this tag can be used
# to set the initial width (in pixels) of the frame in which the tree is shown.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 1500, default value: 250.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

TREEVIEW_WIDTH         = 250

# Use this tag to change the font size of LaTeX formulas included as images in
# the HTML documentation. When you change the font size after a successful
# doxygen run you need to manually remove any form_*.png images from the HTML
# output directory to force them to be regenerated.
# Minimum value: 8, maximum value: 50, default value: 10.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

FORMULA_FONTSIZE       = 10

# Use the FORMULA_TRANPARENT tag to determine whether or not the images
# generated for formulas are transparent PNGs. Transparent PNGs are not
# supported properly for IE 6.0, but are supported on all modern browsers.
#
# Note that when changing this option you need to delete any form_*.png files in
# the HTML output directory before the changes have effect.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

FORMULA_TRANSPARENT    = YES

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES, all private members of a class will

# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be
