# C Coding Style


### Line Width ###

Try to use lines of code between 80 and 120 characters long.

### Indentation ###

We use 4 spaces for indentation.

### Braces ###

1. In GNU style, if either side of an if-else statement has braces, both sides should, to match up indentation:
```cpp	
if (condition):
	{
		Foo;
		Bar;
	}
else:
	{
		Bar;
	}
```
2. If the single statement covers multiple lines, e.g. for functions with many arguments, and it is followed by else or else if:
```cpp
if (condition):
	{
		a_single_statement_with_many_arguments (some_lengthy_argument,
							another_lengthy_argument,
							plus_one);
	}
else:
	{
		another_single_statement (arg1, arg2);
	}
```
3. If the condition is composed of many lines:
```cpp
if	(condition1 ||
	(condition2 && condition3) ||
	condition4 ||
	(condition5 && (condition6 || condition7))):
	{
		A_simple_statement
	}
```


### Conditions ###

Do not check boolean values for equality. By using implicit comparisons, the resulting code can be read more like conversational English. Another rationale is that a 'true' value may not be necessarily equal to whatever the ``TRUE`` macro uses.
The C language uses the value 0 for many purposes. As a numeric value, the end of a string, a null pointer and the FALSE boolean. To make the code clearer, you should write code that highlights the speci?c way 0 is used. So when reading a comparison, it is possible to know the variable type. For boolean variables, an implicit comparison is appropriate because it's already a logical expression.

### Functions ###

The argument list must be broken into a new line for each argument, with the argument names right aligned, taking into account pointers:
```cpp	
void
My_function (some_type_t	type,
	     Another_type_t    *a_pointer,
	     Double_ptr_t     **double_pointer)
{
	...
}
```

The alignment also holds when invoking a function without breaking the line length limit.

### Whitespace ###

When declaring a structure type use newlines to separate logical sections of the structure:
```cpp
struct _GtkWrapBoxPrivate
{
	GtkOrientation        orientation;
	GtkWrapAllocationMode mode;
	
	GtkWrapBoxSpreading   horizontal_spreading;
	GtkWrapBoxSpreading   vertical_spreading;
}
```

### The switch Statement ####

A switch should open a block on a new indentation level, and each case should start on the same indentation level as the curly braces, with the case block on a new indentation level:
```cpp
switch (condition) {
case FOO:
	do_foo ();
	break;
case BAR:
	do_bar;
	break;
}
```

### Header Files ###
The only major rule for headers is that the function definitions should be vertically aligned in three columns:

```cpp
return_type	function_name	(type   argument,
                                 type   argument,
                                 type   argument);
```

The maximum width of each column is given by the longest element in the column:
```cpp
void	      gtk_type_set_property (GtkType      *type,
				     const gchar  *value,
				     GError      **error);
const gchar  *gtk_type_get_property (GtkType      *type);
```
